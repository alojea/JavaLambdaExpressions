LambdaExpressions

Lambda expressions is part of the new features of Java1.8. 

Is simplify way of writting code as Anonymous clases. 

Variable in an enclosing scope can't be change in inner class or 
lambda expression, so you can't change the value of the variable.

In languages that support first class functions, the type of the lambda expression would be a function; 
but in Java, the lambda expressions are represented as objects, and so they must be bound to a particular object type known as a functional interface. 
This is called the target type.
